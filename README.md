--->Hey everyone. I'm brand new in the computer hacking world. I'm honestly not that great with computers but I want to learn. and obviously I'm new at the Flipper Zero. I love the Flipper Zero. but I'm such a novice i can't figure out how to download firmware or anything on github. could someone please explain why I don't see any download options on github when I search for firmware for example. I've seen videos of other ppl on github and they had download buttons on github. why don'tI see download on there? and where can I get firmware that won't tell me I can't do this action in the region I live at with the flipperzero with the currentupdated firmwareI find through the flipper app for Android? help please
